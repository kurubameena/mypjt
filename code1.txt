 Apache Ant is a software tool for automating software build processes,
 which originated from the Apache Tomcat project in early 2000.
 It was a replacement for the Unix make build tool,
 and was created due to a number of problems with the unix make.
 
 The build.xml file, if it is an ant script, is not used to import the project into an IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans.
 A build script is used to build the project (or produce some desired output) 
 rather than an mechanism for importing the project into an IDE.
some of the decritpions will be made by the meena:wq:
