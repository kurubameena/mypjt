 Apache Ant is a software tool for automating software build processes,
 which originated from the Apache Tomcat project in early 2000.
 It was a replacement for the Unix make build tool,
 and was created due to a number of problems with the unix make.
 
 The build.xml file, if it is an ant script, is not used to import the project into an IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans.
 A build script is used to build the project (or produce some desired output) 
 rather than an mechanism for importing the project into an IDE.
